               ### Is predictable
               
               * Is not altered during runtime

               * Will run the same artifacts consistently on every boot


               ### Is scalable

               * Eliminates efforts in configuring individual instances during runtime

               * Can be rolled out easily repeatedly with predictable outcome


               ### Is reliable

               * Automated recovery from faulty updates

               ##  Transactional Updates
               
               ### Unique
               
               By using btrfs with snapshots MicroOS uses a very space
               efficient way to store the file system's history. All the configuration
               files in `/etc` are part of the snapshot and the rollback.

               ### Flexible

               * No new package format is needed

               * No size limitation, neither for partitions nor the operating system

               * Easy to enhance

               ### Rollback
               
               * Immutable: No changes on disk
               
               * Rollback by rebooting to an old snapshot

               * No size limits other the available storage size

               * Get your updates via HTTPS

               * Packages and repositoreis are signed by our build system

               * Packages are verified

               * No updates are ony in case of dependency conflicts

               * No waste of space: Snapshots get deleted in case of unsuccessful updates

  rundown: Applications are installed in containers rather than the root filesystem
  description: >-
               * Isolated from the core filesystem

               * Reduced ability for malicious applications to compromise the system

               * New installation without reboot

               * Update in atomic way possible (create new, kill old)

               * Easy rollback

               ### Read-only root filesystem:

               * Reboot needed to install additional tools
               
               * Situation after reboot is different than before


               ### Toolbox
               
               * Launches small, privileged container

               * Root filesystem available below `/media/root`

               * zypper to install the necessary tools

               * Persistent between usages
